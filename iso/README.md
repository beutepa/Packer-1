### What Is This Directory For?

You should download your Windows Server ISO images from TechNet/MSDN and place them in this folder. We need to do this because MSDN / TechNet are protected by Microsoft (Live) ID, which does not support HTTP basic authentication or the OAuth2 username / password flow.

This repository only supports Windows Server 2012 R2 (Standard edition, which the Data center ISO contains):
